# ${1:Python-video-capture-code}

## This Python code was created back in 2015 for a Psychophysiological project. 
## This code will capture (record) facial expressions of participants when they are exposed to emotional expressions. 
## The video recordings are time stamped and recorded in .avi format. 


# Installation

## I used Python to create this programme. You can find out how to install and use python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/


# Usage

## Feel free to use whatever code you like. All I kindly ask in return is that you cite it appropriately :)
